1. Absolute file path and relative file path
2. ../q1.png(goes to upper level) and ./q1.png(searches in the current directory) accessing the paths with special character
3. </h1> is a closing tag
4. void elements <br>, <hr>, these are also same, <br />,<hr />.
5. <a href="https://stellarium-web.org/">Stellarium</a>, <tag attribute=value>content</tag>
6. if you want an imgae to be hyperlinked then write <a><img/><a> write image inside the anchor
7. <!DOC HTML> represents the version of the html i.e version 5
8. to get the HTML boilerplate code type "!" and then press enter. You can get this for the files that are saved with .html
9. Types of style sheets : css, saas, less
10. 3 ways of adding css to html - inline, internal, external
    inline css goes into opening tag of the html
    <html style="background: blue"></html> , property is background and value is blue
    inline is limited to one element, and internal is limited to one document
    internal css :
    <html>
    <style>
    html{
        background : red;
    }
    </style>
    </html>
    inside teh css file the tag name is called selector
    External css : 
    <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
    </head>
    in the baove rel represents the relationship with the file and href represents the location
    if we are styling the h1, a, p tags then its called the lement selector
    selector represents that which part of the html should the rules apply to. rules written in the curly braces.
    class selector in css starts with a .
    <h1 class="cls-name">qwe</h1>
    .clas-name{
        color:red;
    }
    class selectors always start with the dot
11. id selector starts with #id-name
    <h1 id="main">qwe</h1>
    #main{
        color:red;
    }
    difference between id and class is class is used to apply for many elements but id are only applied for one elemnt. 
    incase u have a special element wher eyou wish to apply it only for that one then use id
12. Attribute selectors
<p draggable="true">qwe</p>
<p draggable="false">qwe</p>
    p[draggable]{
        color: red;
    }
    p[draggable="false"]{
        color:blue;
    }
    the baove code states that for all the p tag elements which have attribute draggable apply the css
    you can also specify with the value specific
13. universal selector
    *{
        color:red;
    }
    applies the css properties to all the elements
14. To revise all this refer to 5.3 module's css file
