#-- Revision
1. Absolute file path and relative file path
2. ../q1.png(goes to upper level) and ./q1.png(searches in the current directory) accessing the paths with special character
3. </h1> is a closing tag
4. void elements <br>, <hr>, these are also same, <br />,<hr />.
5. <a href="https://stellarium-web.org/">Stellarium</a>, <tag attribute=value>content</tag>
6. if you want an imgae to be hyperlinked then write <a><img/><a> write image inside the anchor
7. <!DOC HTML> represents the version of the html i.e version 5
8. to get the HTML boilerplate code type "!" and then press enter. You can get this for the files that are saved with .html
9. Types of style sheets : css, saas, less
10. 3 ways of adding css to html - inline, internal, external
    inline css goes into opening tag of the html
    <html style="background: blue"></html> , property is background and value is blue
    inline is limited to one element, and internal is limited to one document
    internal css :
    <html>
    <style>
    html{
        background : red;
    }
    </style>
    </html>
    inside teh css file the tag name is called selector
    External css : 
    <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
    </head>
    in the baove rel represents the relationship with the file and href represents the location
    if we are styling the h1, a, p tags then its called the lement selector
    selector represents that which part of the html should the rules apply to. rules written in the curly braces.
    class selector in css starts with a .
    <h1 class="cls-name">qwe</h1>
    .clas-name{
        color:red;
    }
    class selectors always start with the dot
11. id selector starts with #id-name
    <h1 id="main">qwe</h1>
    #main{
        color:red;
    }
    difference between id and class is class is used to apply for many elements but id are only applied for one elemnt. 
    incase u have a special element wher eyou wish to apply it only for that one then use id
12. Attribute selectors
<p draggable="true">qwe</p>
<p draggable="false">qwe</p>
    p[draggable]{
        color: red;
    }
    p[draggable="false"]{
        color:blue;
    }
    the baove code states that for all the p tag elements which have attribute draggable apply the css
    you can also specify with the value specific
13. universal selector
    *{
        color:red;
    }
    applies the css properties to all the elements
14. To revise all this refer to 5.3 module's css file
15. font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif - so if Helvetica is not supported in the os it uses next font sans-serif.
sans-serif is the generic font type. This is the reson why they use mutiple fonts in the font family.
16. font-family: "Times New Roman", serif - it is important to use double quotes for the fonts that have spaces.
The system will recognise it only if it is mentioned in double quotes.
17. fonts : em for the parent tag, rem for the root tag
18. in chrome dev inspection got to css overview for colors fonts and etc.
19. computed tab show ewhat are the final styles applied on the element
20. crossed styles represent that the respective ones are overridden
21. element->padding->border->margin. you can give 4 separate values like top, right, down, left.
But if you only give 2 values then 1-top&down, 2-right&left. 
22. So div tags are used to group elements and create a box.
23 chroe extension named pesticide is used for identifying div boxes.
24. The hierarchy of style applied are external style sheets->internal styles--> inline styles.
25. Refer to diagram for hierarchy of css rules. Importance > Type > Specificity > Position.
26. grouping css selectors 1. selector1, selector2..... 
        2. selector1 > selector2 this is a parent and child... it is the direct child not a grand child, it is the first generation child
        Apply to the direct child of left div -> p
        3. Descendant selector : selector1 selector2 which is a descendant. so for the parent there can be any number of inner childs
        still they all are descendents. div1 -> div2 -> p, now both p and div2 are descendants of div1
        4. chaining selectors apply where all selectors are True. selector1selector2  h1.class#main 
        it is always better to start with element then class and id. we will write very specific to an element.
        5. combining selectors. you can combine the above 4 selectors. selector1 selector2selector3
these are selctors so they can be anything like id selectors, class selectors
27. CSS positioning. Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed.
Refer to the ink above for better understanding. Do the 7.2 module for practice.
28. CSS Display property. block, inline, inline-block. 
29. CSS float, left and right. for removing the float we can use clear : left; , clear : right;, clear : both;.
30. The reason they use the keyword screen in media query is that it will only be used when they print.
31. we use display : flex; or display : inline-flex;, and gap : 10px;
32. flex-direction: row; , column;. flex-basis : more like padding towards the flex-direction.
33. Flex sizing : content width < Width or Height < Flex-Basis < Min-width/Max-width.
    1. if width : 100px; but the container is too small it will override the width and shrink the data(items)
    2. width : 100px; and flex-basis : 200px; in this case the width is overridden and flex-basis is considered.
    But if the container doesn't have 200px then it will consider the min-width.
    3. flex-basis : 200px; max-width : 100px; then it will consider the max-width.
    4. if the flex-basis : 50px; and max-width : 100px; then it will consider flex-basis i.e that 50px;
    5. flex-basis : 200px; min-width : 300px; item size will be 300px; and it will disappear(go-off) below this point.
    6. flex-basis : 100px; flex-grow: 0; flex-shrink: 0; then the container items will start at 100px and doesn't grow or shrink.
    they stay constant.
    7. flex-basis : 100px; flex-grow : 1; flex-shrink : 0; then the intial item size value will be 100px; but the items in 
    teh container will grow upto the window size. But they only shrink until the 100px size and then later the data goes off.
    8. flex-basis : 100px; flex-grow : 0; flex-shrink : 1; then the intial size is always 100px but it will not grow.
    but it will shrink until the min-width(default...content-width...min word len). Then later it will go-off data will disappear.
    9. flex-basis: 100px; flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; then it will grow to maximum deoth and it will shrink to minimum depth.
    10. flex-basis : auto; flex-grow : 1; flex-shrink : 1; then it will assign individual size to each and every item based on its word len.
    and the sizes grow and shrink dynamically depending on the window size.
    11. flex : 1 1 0; this means grow=1, shrink=1, flex-basis=0; 
34. Grid. Difference between flex and grid. Flex is a tool to align content on a one dimension.
    Grid is a tool to layout content on a 2 dimensional plane.
    1. Instead of using both grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns we can just use grid-template : 1fr 2fr / 1fr 1fr;
    2. we can use "auto" in the template-rows. 
    grid-template-columns : 200px auto; -> the 1st column will be 200px wide and the 2nd column will occupy as much space as it can.
    grid-template-rows : 100px auto; the 1st row occupies 100px size but the 2nd row occupies only the content size(fit content). *** impo note ***
    For the Grid Sizing
    3. Fixed Sizing. Auto Size using auto keyword. 
    Fractional Size uses "fr"
    MinMax size : 100px minmax(400px, 800px)
    Repeat : repeat(2, 100px) this is same as 100px 100px
    if the matrix is more than the items then it starts filling from row 1 and leaves empty spaces in the remaining
    If we declare sizes for less items then the remaining items will go down but with the content size.
    So to handle the future divs or non-declared divs we use grid-auto-rows : 100px; grid-auto-columns : 100px;
    4. Grid placement... we use grid-column : span 2;
    grid-area : 2 / 1 / 3 / 3; which is grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end
    Note : if you want to use grid area then use grid area on all the items.
